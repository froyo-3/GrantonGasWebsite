          Discover the heart of Edinburgh’s waterfront transformation. At the
          centre of a £1.3 billion regeneration of the Granton waterfront, the
          Granton Gas Holder stands as a powerful symbol of Edinburgh’s
          industrial heritage and bright future. This iconic structure,
          recently brought to life through a series of innovative lighting
          installations and creative multimedia events by talented Edinburgh
          College students, is more than just a landmark — it’s a celebration
          of community, history, and creative vision.

        <h1>The History of the Granton Gas Holder</h1>
        <p>
          From industrial powerhouse to cultural landmark. The Granton Gas
          Holder has stood proudly on Edinburgh’s northern shoreline for over
          a century, a striking reminder of the city’s industrial past and
          engineering prowess. Constructed in 1903, the gas holder was once
          part of the Granton Gasworks, a vital facility that provided gas for
          homes, businesses, and street lighting across Edinburgh.
