            as it stood in 1903 — a bustling hub of industry and 
            innovation at the height of Edinburgh’s gas production era. 
            Dominating the scene is the original Granton Gas Holder, 
            newly built just a few years earlier in 1903, with its

           Discover the heart of Edinburgh’s waterfront transformation.
           At the centre of a £1.3 billion regeneration of the Granton 
           waterfront, the Granton Gas Holder stands as a powerful 
           symbol of Edinburgh’s industrial heritage and bright future.
           This iconic structure, recently brought to life through a 
           series of innovative lighting installations and creative 
           multimedia events by talented Edinburgh College students, 
           is more than just a landmark — it’s a celebration of 
           community, history, and creative vision.

            <!-- text here -->
           From industrial powerhouse to cultural landmark.
           The Granton Gas Holder has stood proudly on Edinburgh’s
           northern shoreline for over a century, a striking 
           reminder of the city’s industrial past and engineering 
           prowess. Constructed in 1903, the gas holder was once 
           part of the Granton Gasworks, a vital facility that 
           provided gas for homes, businesses, and street lighting 
           across Edinburgh.
